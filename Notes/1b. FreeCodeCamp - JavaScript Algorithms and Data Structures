JAVASCRIPT

Declare a variable:
  let character;
Assign a string to a variable upon declaration:
  let character = "Hello";
To print character in the console:
  console.log(character);

Variable naming with multiple words:
  manyWordVariable

An Array holds a series of values.
Arrays are declared like this:
  let array = [];
To access a value in the array, use the index:
  array[0], array[1], array[2],...
To find out how many elements are in an array:
  arrayLength = array.length;
To access the last element in an array of unknown length:
  array[array.length - 1];
To add an element to the end of an array:
  array.push(12);
To remove the last element of an array and return the element:
  array.pop()
The .unshift() method of an array allows you to add a value to the beginning of the array.
Arrays also have a .shift() method. This will remove the first element of the array.

To make a variable that cannot be reassigned:
  const character = "Hello";

For loops:
  for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
  }
    >>  The iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in your for 
          loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic.

A function is a block of code that can be reused throughout your application.
  function name(parameter) {
  }

>>>
  if {}
  else if {}
  else {}
>>>

A while loop will run over and over again until the condition specified is no longer true.
  while (condition) {
  logic;
  }

Arrays have a special length property that allows you to see how many values, or elements, 
  are in the array. You would access this property using syntax like myArray.length.
