## HTML scratch

Prioritize text with header elements:
	<h1>Priority 1 text</h1>
	<h2>Priority 2 text</h2>

Paragraph of text uses <p> element:
	<p>Paragraph of text</p>

To make a comment:
	<!--Insert comment here!-->

The <main> element is used to represent the main content of the body of an 
 HTML document. Helps for Engine Optimization and accessability:
  <html>
    <body>
      <main>
	<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
	<h2>Cat Photos</h2>
	<!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
	<p>Everyone loves cute cats online!</p>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>

NESTING is when you put the h1, h2, comment, and p elements inside the 
 main element.

A void element is an element where it uses an opening tag but
 no closing tag:
  <img>
<img> is the image element, which has no closing tag

HTML ATTRIBUTES are special words used inside the opening tag of an 
 element to control the element's behavior:
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg">
All <img> elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for 
 screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load:
  <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat">

Link to another page with the anchor <a> element:
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a>
You can use the target attribute on the anchor <a> element to open links in a new tab:
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
You can turn an image or other types of content into a link:
  <a href="example-link">
  <img src="image-link.jpg" alt="A photo of a cat.">
  </a>

The s<ection> element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, 
 footers, or any other sections of the document:
  <section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Section content...</p>
  </section>

To create an unordered list of items, you can use the <ul> element.
The <li> element is used to create a list item in an ordered or unordered list.
  <ul>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
  </ul>
The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in 
 an ordered list are numbered when displayed.

The <figure> element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an 
 image with a caption.
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained 
 within the figure element.
  <figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
    <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption>
  </figure>

To place emphasis (italicize) on a specific word or phrase, you can use the <em> element. 
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent (bold).

The <form> element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details.

The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent.
  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
  </form>
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input 
 elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.

Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input.
  <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL">

To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the 
 <required> attribute to an input element.

The <button> element is used to create a clickable button.

Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. 
 That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.

You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options. To 
 make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name 
 attribute with the same value.

label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself 
 (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers).

The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique 
 from all other id values for the entire page.

The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements 
 are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.

The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about 
 what they should enter into that part of the form.

Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. The input element with a type 
 attribute set to checkbox creates a checkbox.

Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute 
 is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.

In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute 
 to it.

The footer element is used to define a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains information 
 about the author of the document, copyright data, links to terms of use, contact information, and more.

The head element is used to contain metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and 
 scripts. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page.

The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English. 

All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser 
 tries to meet industry-wide specifications. <!DOCTYPE html> tells browsers that the document is an HTML5 document 
 which is the latest version of HTML.

You can set browser behavior by adding meta elements in the head. Inside the head element, nest a meta element with 
 an attribute named charset. Set to the value to utf-8 which tells the browser how to encode characters for the page.


## CSS scratch

Every HTML document should have a DOCTYPE declaration and html element. The DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of 
 HTML the document is in. And the html element represents the root element which contains all other elements.

How to add a background image:
  body {
  background-image: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg);
  }

<article> elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.
